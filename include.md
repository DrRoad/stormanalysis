### Welcome to storms and other severe weather events analysis

Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities. Many severe events can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern.

This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration's (NOAA) storm database. This database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property 
damage.

The events in the database start in the year 1950 and end in November 2011. In 
the earlier years of the database there are generally fewer events recorded, 
most likely due to a lack of good records. More recent years should be 
considered more complete.

The year range from the starting year to the ending year can be varied from
the slider knots with the selected event types to observe the populution and 
economic impacts by state as well as graphically by year.
